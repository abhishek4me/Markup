    <ul>
        <li>Summer Session: 15 June 2025</li>
        <li>Fall Semester: 25 August 2025</li>
        <li>Spring Semester: 12 January 2026</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please confirm your preferred start date so we can prepare your research workspace accordingly.
    </p><br>
    <p>Additional information about our research facilities can be found on our <a href="http://example.com">department website.</a></p>
    
    <h3>Research Focus Areas</h3>
    <p>Our Environmental Engineering lab specializes in cutting-edge sustainability solutions with real-world applications. Based on your background in renewable energy systems, we're particularly excited about these research opportunities:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Solar panel efficiency optimization using titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocoatings and their impact on photovoltaic conversion rates.</li>
        <li>Biogas production from organic waste, specifically measuring methane (CH4) output at temperatures ranging from 35°C to 55°C (95°F to 131°F) with bacterial populations of 2 × 105 to 8 × 105 cells per milliliter.</li>
        <li>Smart grid integration protocols for renewable energy distribution networks.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We'd appreciate a detailed proposal outlining your methodology, expected timeline, required equipment, and potential collaboration opportunities with our chemistry department. Your expertise would be invaluable to these projects.</p>
    
    <h3>Unique Expertise</h3>
    <p>You mentioned my background in competitive rock climbing - absolutely! During my graduate years, I was actively involved in technical climbing competitions. Here are some of my specialized skills:</p>
    
    <dt>Alpine ice climbing</dt>
    <dd>
        A demanding discipline requiring precise technique on frozen waterfalls and glacial formations. I've completed routes rated WI5+ (Waterfall Ice grade 5+), involving vertical sections over 100 meters with temperatures below -15°C (5°F).
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Big wall aid climbing</dt>
    <dd>
        Multi-day ascents of massive rock faces using technical gear placements. My most challenging accomplishment was a 4-day ascent of El Capitan's "The Nose" route, covering 914 meters (3,000 feet) of granite while carrying 25 kilograms of equipment and supplies.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Sport climbing competition</dt>
    <dd>
        Indoor competitive climbing on artificial holds with specific route difficulties. I competed at the national level, successfully completing routes graded 5.13a on the Yosemite Decimal System, which requires finger strength capable of supporting body weight on holds smaller than 1 centimeter.
    </dd>
    
    <p>You can see photos from my climbing expeditions on my <a href="http://example.com">adventure portfolio page.</a></p>
    <p>Looking forward to your research contributions,<br>Prof. Maria Rodriguez</p>
